PHP Console
===========

A web console to try your PHP code into

Creating a test file or using php's interactive mode can be a bit cumbersome to try random php snippets. This allows you to run small bits of code easily right from your browser.

It is secure since accessible only from the local host, and very easy to setup and use.
